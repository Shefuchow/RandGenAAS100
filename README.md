                  readings for our weekly verbal quizes. He can like smell the fear or
                  sense the lack of effort from students and he asks them very specific
                  questions about the readings. However, the class complained that that
                  method wasn't a fair repersentation of the class (because we all 
                  recieve the same grade for the day for that quiz). So the class wanted
                  a randomizer, and there were issues with his "random" methods and then  
                  I volunteered myself to make him a simple lightweight web app that would
                  randomize student's names for him." << std::endl;
